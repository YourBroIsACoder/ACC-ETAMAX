## 😈 Troll Hints (What Teams Actually See)

**The hints in the app are intentionally misleading and hilarious!**

### Group A
- **Tree 99:** *"Try looking for Tree 66 first. If that doesn't work, have you considered checking the library?"*
- **Broken Door:** *"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But what if it IS broke? Then fix it. Wait, no, don't fix it. Just find it. Or don't. Your choice! 🚪"*
- **Water Pool:** *"The answer is NOT 'swimming pool.' Also NOT 'kiddie pool.' Try checking if there's a pool table somewhere? 🎱💧"*

### Group B
- **Tree 48:** *"Did you know? Trees were invented in 1843. Also, this has nothing to do with actual trees. Check the parking lot maybe? 🌴"*
- **Girls Entrance AC:** *"Stay cool. Like, literally. Or figuratively. Actually, try the boys' entrance first, we might have put it there by mistake 🤷‍♂️❄️"*
- **Watchman Cabin:** *"Fun fact: Watchmen watch. But do they cabin? Philosophy is hard. Try asking the principal's office maybe? 🤔🏠"*

### Group C
- **Tree 80:** *"80 looks like 'BO' if you turn it sideways. Bob might know something. Go find Bob. Good luck finding Bob!"*
- **Warli Pillar:** *"Warli rhymes with Barley. Barley is used to make beer. The canteen sells soft drinks. Coincidence? I think NOT! 🍺🎨"*
- **Red Pipes:** *"Red pipes... like Mario! Have you tried jumping on them? No? Well, neither have we. YouTube might help! 🔴🔧"*

### Finals
- **Swan Crown:** *"Swans are just fancy ducks. Have you checked the cafeteria? They might serve duck. Also, crowns are overrated. Try finding a swan with a hat instead! 👑🦆"*
- **Electric Pole:** *"Congratulations on making it this far! Your prize is: this useless hint. The pole might be electric. Or magnetic. Or just a really tall stick. Who knows? We certainly don't! ⚡🎉"*

**These hints are designed to make teams laugh while NOT giving away the answers!** 🤣
