## 🔐 Encryption Methods Reference

### 1. Caesar Cipher
- **How it works:** Shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions
- **Example:** A → H (shift +7), "HELLO" → "OLSSV"
- **Decryption:** Shift back by the same amount
- **Tools:** CyberChef, dcode.fr, or manual calculation

### 2. ROT13
- **How it works:** Special case of Caesar Cipher (shift +13)
- **Example:** "HELLO" → "URYYB"
- **Unique feature:** Applying ROT13 twice gives the original text
- **Tools:** rot13.com, CyberChef

### 3. Morse Code
- **How it works:** Dots (.) and dashes (-) represent letters
- **Example:** "HELP" → ".... . .-.. .--."
- **Spacing:** Letters separated by spaces, words by `/` or multiple spaces
- **Tools:** morsecode.world, CyberChef

### 4. Binary (8-bit ASCII)
- **How it works:** Each character as 8-bit binary number
- **Example:** "A" → `01000001`
- **Format:** Usually space-separated bytes
- **Tools:** rapidtables.com, CyberChef

### 5. Hexadecimal
- **How it works:** ASCII values in hexadecimal (base-16)
- **Example:** "HELLO" → `48 45 4C 4C 4F`
- **Format:** Space or colon-separated pairs
- **Tools:** asciitohex.com, CyberChef

### 6. Base64
- **How it works:** Binary-to-text encoding scheme
- **Example:** "HELLO" → `SEVMTE8=`
- **Identification:** Often ends with `=` or `==` padding
- **Tools:** base64decode.org, CyberChef

### 7. Vigenere Cipher
- **How it works:** Polyalphabetic substitution using a keyword
- **Example:** "ATTACK" with key "KEY" → "KXVOCR"
- **Key required:** Must know or guess the encryption key
- **Tools:** dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher, CyberChef

### 8. Atbash Cipher
- **How it works:** A↔Z, B↔Y, C↔X (reverse alphabet)
- **Example:** "HELLO" → "SVOOL"
- **Unique feature:** Symmetric - encrypt and decrypt are the same
- **Tools:** dcode.fr/atbash-cipher

### 9. Polybius Square
- **How it works:** Letters mapped to coordinates in a 5×5 grid
- **Example:** "HELLO" → "23 15 31 31 34"
- **Grid:** Usually uses 1-5 for rows and columns
- **Tools:** dcode.fr/polybius-cipher
